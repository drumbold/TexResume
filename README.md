This is the resume and cover letter template I use in LaTeX.

This resume and cover letter are based off [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and inspired by the resume found at [jennaburnett.com](https://jennaburnett.com/resume/). I modified the original template to better fit a US resume instead of the CV which is common in Europe and Asia.

Feel free to fork and edit.
